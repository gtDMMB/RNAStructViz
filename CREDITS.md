## Funding sources supporting the development of this software


## External contributions, icons and artwork

The images used in ``RNAStructViz``, namely those in the 
[with-cairo/src/pixmaps/*.c](https://github.com/gtDMMB/RNAStructViz/tree/with-cairo/src/pixmaps) folder, 
have been obtained as freeware icons from the [FlatIcon](flaticon.com) site. The first two
particular icons (see [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/dna_620410#term=dna&page=1&position=81) and 
[here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/business-affiliate-network_66585#term=structure&page=1&position=1)) 
which we have modified from this site which appear in the main application 
are credited to the author [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/). 
The two icons modified in the configuration options dialog artwork are due to 
Egor Rumyantsev [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/settings-work-tool_70367#term=settings&page=1&position=4) and
Freepik again [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/writing_1001371#term=file&page=1&position=3). 
The images used to create the icon in the PNG path selection dialog are contributed by 
Freepik [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/move-to-next_64491#term=right%20arrow&page=1&position=17), 
by Smashicons [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/png_136441#term=png&page=1&position=12), and by 
Freepik [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/links-folder_179#term=directory&page=1&position=10).
The modifications of these black-and-white icons 
we have made to appear in our program were performed with [The GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) open-source 
image editing application. 
The other images modified for display in our README file are originally
obtained from the [FlatIcon](flaticon.com) site.
