## External contributions

The images used in ``RNAStructViz``, namely those in the 
[with-cairo/src/pixmaps/*.c](https://github.com/gtDMMB/RNAStructViz/tree/with-cairo/src/pixmaps) folder, 
have been obtained as freeware icons from the [FlatIcon](flaticon.com) site. The two 
particular icons (see [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/dna_620410#term=dna&page=1&position=81) and 
[here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/business-affiliate-network_66585#term=structure&page=1&position=1)) 
which we have modified from this site which appear in the main application 
are credited to the author [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/). The modifications of these black-and-white icons 
we have made to appear in our program were performed with [The GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) open-source 
image editing application.
