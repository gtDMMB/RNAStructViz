Add files/folders summary pop up
Clean out old callbacks

Bugs:
Deleting files from a folder can segfault when you try to open a comparison window
Deleting all the files from a folder may result in the name of another folder button
	reading from the wrong address (specifically the selected folder) or segfault
DiagramWindow doesn't always greyout OpenGL when you open/reopen DiagramWindows

Future things to add:
Configure file accounts for fltk in other locations
Folder naming
	Change default to not include filetype
	If all blanks, enter filename (currently you can have a name of spaces)
	Ignore preceding blanks?
In the diagram window, can we grey-out the structures already selected?
	Not sure if possible, all the drop-downs use the same menu_items
Add loadable filetypes that are in other programs

Code issues:
Memory Management issues
	Use valgrind, gdb
	When adding & removing files, memory leaks and segfaults
	Check return values (what if malloc fails?)
COMMENT CODE
	clear dead commented code, clean up code

Changes to consider:
Resizing FolderWindow will expand the scrollbox of structures
Export InputWindow for StatsWindow says which StatsWindow it's connected to
Reference structure in StatsWindow titlebar
Clear tables/diagram on close instead of open (overwrite hide() function)
Garbage collect Diagram/StatsWindows on close instead of reopening
Replace dropdown & check boxes with list of structures with both a radio button 
	(for reference) and check box (for comparison) next to it?
Let them pick (check boxes) which statistics to show
	-Extra histogram tab with one big histogram (or four changeable ones)
	-Can pick with statistics for table
Exporting: Allow user to specify location
Save current structure (at least indices) & reference so only calculate 
	when it's a different structure
