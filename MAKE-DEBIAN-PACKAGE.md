# Notes on creating the *UNSUPPORTED* Debian (.deb) packages linked with the latest release 

My rationale for disobeying orders is this: one of our key developers and 
sources of feedback on releases, 
[**@annakirkpatrick**](https://github.com/annakirkpatrick), 
is based primarily on a Debian Linux variant, as is 
[**@maxieds**](https://github.com/maxieds), though the latter is compiling and 
developing from source on my local box. Anna needs a solid way to get 
releases to her Linux box for immediate testing without a complicated or 
lengthy typographically install procedure, which is currently the case for 
from-source installs of the *RNAStructViz* software. Therefore, to at least 
temporarily resolve this issue while we are still actively testing new 
releases to fix existing bugs in the out-of-date portions that remain in the 
source these days, I am going to provide a quick-and-easy, but 
most importantly **UNSUPPORTED FOR USER INSTALLS**, Debian package to 
facilitate our core developers getting their active hands on the most 
up-to-date revisions of *RNAStructViz*. These *deb* packages should be 
(when and while they are available) posted as binary subfiles on the project 
[latest release](https://github.com/gtDMMB/RNAStructViz/releases/latest) 
page. 

The instructions for preparing these Debian *.deb* packages for our uses 
to that end are referenced
