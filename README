Visualization software for RNA folding structures.

The software has been verified to work on Linux and Mac systems. 
It requires the g++ compiler, the X11 and OpenGL libraries, and the FLTK package to be installed on your machine. X11 and OpenGL often come packaged with the g++ compiler on many systems.

FLTK Installation instructions:

To download FLTK, go to http://www.fltk.org/ and look for the latest stable 
build version of fltk 1.3 (version 2.0 or later will NOT work). After you have downloaded and unpacked the archive, navigate to the fltk directory from the terminal and run
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
to install it on your machine. Note: the "sudo make install" command will ask for the password associated with your login and requires that your user profile has administrator access.

For Ubuntu users, you can alternatively run "sudo apt-get install libfltk1.3-dev" from the terminal and it will install FLTK and any other necessary packages.

To test that FLTK is installed on your machine, you can type
  fltk-config --version
in the terminal and check that it recognizes the command and returns the version number
of the installed version on your machine. Installations of versions 1.1 or 1.3 should be
sufficient; make sure you are not using version 2.0.



To Install RNAStructViz:
Download the repository from github. After you have unpacked the archive, navigate to
the RNAStructViz directory in the terminal. Run the following:
  ./configure
  make
This should compile the software on your machine. The RNAStructViz executable will 
then be found in the RNAStructViz/src directory, and can be run by typing
  ./RNAStructViz
From within that directory.
